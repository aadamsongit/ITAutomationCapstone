# Project Overview

A high school has reported the grades for students in three core subjects. Initially, the grades have been stored in a data dictionary, along with keys for the students' names and for each subject. These final grades will be assessed with a curve of ten points, and there may be an additional student who needs to be added to the final report.

The tasks that this project aims to automate include sorting the data for the grades into CSV files by subject, then e-mailing each file individually. In addition to sorting the data dictionary into CSV files and generating an email, the code needs to have a function to input an additional student, as well as adding the ten point curve to each grade. Finally, the code also needs to generate a print statement to comment on the progress of each of the three classes, either by noting that the students are performing very well and meeting or exceeding expectations, or by making a note that the students may need additional tutoring or remedial assistance.
