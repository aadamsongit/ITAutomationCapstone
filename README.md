Project Overview

A high school has reported the grades for students in three core subjects. Initially, the grades have been stored in a data dictionary, along with keys for the students' names and for each subject. These final grades will be assessed with a curve of ten points, and there may be an additional student who needs to be added to the final report.

The task that this project aims to automate is sorting the data for the grades into CSV files by subject, then e-mailing each file individually. In addition to sorting the data dictionary into CSV files and generating an email, the code needs to have a function to input an additional student, as well as adding the ten point curve to each grade.
